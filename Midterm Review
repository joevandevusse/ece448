Pareto Optimum - impossible to make outcome better for one without making it worse for other
Nash Equilibrium - not Pareto Optimum

1. Known - know rules, observable - know world state. Both can exist like Battleship
2. World state vs. search tree node
  Node contains world state
4. a. Same complexity
   b. BFS better in worst case
   c. BFS better in worst case
DFS has bad worst case with some very long paths
Iterative deepening makes this better, complexity of BFS * 2
DFS has much lower memory cost than BFS (1 expanded path vs. whole tree)
5. Greedy Best First - h(n)
A* - f(n) = h(n) + g(n)
  g(n) = path cost to n
  h(n) <= path cost from n to g
Standard GBFS - choose child with lowest h(n)
Repaired GBFS - choose child with lowest g(n) + h(n)
  (Perhaps disregard the statement below?)
  A* like this, but A* continues until there is no remaining better path
  Disregarded because the first one we will find will be optimum if
A* admissible - first path to goal is best IF you re-search already explored states
  h(n) <= path cost at the end
A* consistent - first path to goal is best EVEN IF you never repeat a state
  Path from beginning also bounded
7. Local search = making small changes to get to goal?
  Local search might be good for CSP's with multiple solutions
8. Branching factor = 25
15. Mixed strategy - A chooses R1 with probability P, R2 with probability (1-P)
  such that E[utility to B(R1)] = E[utility to B(R2)]
  E[utility to B of R1] = (utility if A=R1)*P(A=R1) + (utility if A=R2)*P(A=R2)
  = (1/2)*P + 1*(1-P) so (1/2)P + 1(1-P) = 1*P + (1/2)*(1-P) => P = 1/2
